# DESCRIPTION

; TODO: Decide on and document driver exit statuses
*hare build* compiles a Hare program into an executable. The _path_ argument
shall be either the path to a Hare source file, or to a directory which contains
a Hare module (see *MODULES* below), or may be omitted, in which case the
working directory shall contain the Hare module to build.

*hare deps* queries the dependencies graph of a Hare program. The _path_ argument
is equivalent in usage to *hare build*.

*hare run* compiles and runs a Hare program. The _path_ argument is equivalent
in usage to *hare build*. If provided, any additional _args_ are passed to the
Hare program which is run. os::args[0] is set to the _path_ argument.

*hare test* compiles and runs tests for Hare code. All Hare modules in the
current working directory are recursively discovered, built, and their tests
made eligible for the test run. If the _test_ argument is omitted, all tests are
run. Otherwise, the list of named tests are run.

*hare version* prints version information for the *hare* program, as well as
some information about the build parameters.

# OPTIONS

## hare build

*-c*
	Compile only, do not link. The output is an object file (for Hare-only
	modules) or archive (for mixed source modules).

*-v*
	Enable verbose logging. Prints every command to stderr before executing
	it.

*-D* _ident:type=value_
	Passed to *harec*(1) to define an object in the type system. _ident_
	shall be the identifier of this object (e.g. foo::bar::baz), _type_
	shall be its type (in Hare syntax, e.g. "str" or
	"struct { x: int, y: int }"), and _value_ shall be the desired value (as a
	Hare expression, e.g. "42"). Take care to address any necessary
	escaping to avoid conflicts between your shell syntax and Hare syntax.

*-j* _jobs_
	Defines the maximum number of jobs which *hare* will execute in
	parallel. The default is the number of processors available on the host.

*-l* _name_
	Link with the named system library. The name is passed to
	*pkg-config --libs* (see *pkg-config*(1)) to obtain the appropriate
	linker flags.

*-o* _path_
	Set the output file to the given path.

*-t* _arch_
	Set the desired architecture for cross-compiling. See *ARCHITECTURES*
	for supported architecture names.

*-T* _tags_
	Adds additional build tags, separated by commas.

*-X* _tags_
	Unsets build tags, separated by commas. See *hare version* for the list
	of tags available by default.

## hare deps

*-d*
	Print depenency graph as a dot file for use with *graphviz*(1).

*-M*
	Print rules compatible with POSIX *make*(1).

*-T* _tags_
	Adds additional build tags, separated by commas.

*-X* _tags_
	Unsets build tags, separated by commas. See *hare version* for the list
	of tags available by default.

## hare run

*-v*
	Enable verbose logging. Prints every command to stderr before executing
	it.

*-D* _ident:type=value_
	Passed to *harec*(1) to define an object in the type system. _ident_
	shall be the identifier of this object (e.g. foo::bar::baz), _type_
	shall be its type (in Hare syntax, e.g. "str" or
	"struct { x: int, y: int }"), and _value_ shall be the desired value (as a
	Hare expression, e.g. "42"). Take care to address any necessary
	escaping to avoid conflicts between your shell syntax and Hare syntax.

*-j* _jobs_
	Defines the maximum number of jobs which *hare* will execute in
	parallel. The default is the number of processors available on the host.

*-l* _name_
	Link with the named system library. The name is passed to
	*pkg-config --libs* (see *pkg-config*(1)) to obtain the appropriate
	linker flags.

*-T* _tags_
	Adds additional build tags, separated by commas.

*-X* _tags_
	Unsets build tags, separated by commas. See *hare version* for the list
	of tags available by default.

## hare test

*-v*
	Enable verbose logging. Prints every command to stderr before executing
	it.

*-D* _ident:type=value_
	Passed to *harec*(1) to define an object in the type system. _ident_
	shall be the identifier of this object (e.g. foo::bar::baz), _type_
	shall be its type (in Hare syntax, e.g. "str" or
	"struct { x: int, y: int }"), and _value_ shall be the desired value (as a
	Hare expression, e.g. "42"). Take care to address any necessary
	escaping to avoid conflicts between your shell syntax and Hare syntax.

*-j* _jobs_
	Defines the maximum number of jobs which *hare* will execute in
	parallel. The default is the number of processors available on the host.

*-l* _name_
	Link with the named system library. The name is passed to
	*pkg-config --libs* (see *pkg-config*(1)) to obtain the appropriate
	linker flags.

*-T* _tags_
	Adds additional build tags, separated by commas.

*-X* _tags_
	Unsets build tags, separated by commas. See *hare version* for the list
	of tags available by default.
