The datetime module implements the international de facto "Gregorian"
chronology, based on the astronomically numbered, proleptic Gregorian
calendar, as per ISO 8601. It provides [[datetime]], a representation of
civil date/time and an extension of the [[chrono::moment]] type,
optimized for dealing with the Gregorian chronology.

Datetimes are created with [[new]] or [[now]], or be constructed piece
by piece via a [[builder]].

For arithmetics, use [[diff]], [[add]] and [[hop]]. Note that
calendrical arithmetic is highly irregular with many edge cases, so
think carefully about what you want.

[[datetime]] instances are designed to always be valid and internally
consistent. The one exception is during timezone transitions.
Non-existant datetimes should be tested for by attempting to converting
them to their "normal" timezone (usually UTC0).

Both formatting and parsing use POSIX specifiers (see strptime(3)).
