bufio provides [[io::stream]] implementations which provide buffered I/O
operations. The [[buffered]] stream will batch reads and writes for an
underlying stream, using a caller-provided buffer as temporary storage. The
[[dynamic]] and [[fixed]] streams produce an [[io::stream]] which reads from or
writes to a data buffer (dynamically and statically allocated, respectively).

Utilities for "scanning" a stream are also provided via [[scantok]] et al. These
will work with any [[io::stream]], but are only efficient on a [[buffered]]
stream.

The use of a [[buffered]] stream also allows the caller to utilize the
[[unread]] family of functions.
