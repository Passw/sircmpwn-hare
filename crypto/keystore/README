TODO: Add link

The keystore module provides a means of securely storing private information,
ideally through the assistance of operating system key storage facilities. The
purpose of this feature is to store private data without keeping it in the
process's address space, so that bugs which can lead to reading process memory
cannot recover the key while it's not actively in use.

On platforms without a suitable feature, a fallback implementation stores the
secrets in the process heap, providing no security. This is an opportunistic API
which allows your program to take advantage of these features if available.
