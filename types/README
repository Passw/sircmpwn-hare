The types module provides runtime access to the Hare type system. It provides
constants like [[INT_MAX]], which defines the useful range for integer types
(see [[math]] for f32 and f64 limits), as well as types like [[slice_repr]],
which describe the internal structure of data types like slices and str.

The types module additionally provides support for reflection. A typical program
which needs to make use of reflection will pass a type value to [[reflect]],
like so:

	let info = types::reflect(type(str));
	assert(info.repr is types::builtin::STR);

Additional helpers like [[unwrap]] are provided to further assist with
reflection-related tasks.
