The io_uring module provides access to Linux's io_uring subsystem. The
documentation for this module is somewhat scarce: users are presumed to be
familiar with io_uring. Thus, it is recommended that a reading of this module is
paired with the Linux documentation, which may be available from your local
liburing package under the io_uring_setup, io_uring_enter, and io_uring_register
man pages.
